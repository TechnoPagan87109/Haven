The MarketPlace

The MarketPlace has a wide and ever changing variety of colorful tents and stands acting as outlets for the more permanent and better stocked shops around Haven as well as for the farmers to sell their wares. Then of course there’s Myk’s Magic Shoppe, which despite appearances is definitely not a tent. At the center of the Marketplace is the Town Well, looked over by a statue of Chauntea, goddess of agriculture. At the south end of the Marketplace is the Bulletin Board. Residents post notices for everything from “Lost Cat” to “Room for Rent” to “Adventurers Wanted”.

Myk's Magic Shoppe
Billed as an emporium of wonder Myk's Magic Shoppe appears as an ordinary covered market tent. It is deceptively small and ordinary looking on the outside, but inside it is a labyrinth of magical workshops, display and gathering rooms where adventurers come to buy and sell Magic items, ask advice and exchange information.

Mykazhin (Myk) Longreen
Myk Longreen is very intelligent, wise and powerful. He runs Myk’s Magic Shoppe. He is willing to give advice when it’s asked for and people rarely regret taking it. While not officially part of the Exploration House, they keep each other in the loop.

Chormongondr
Chormongondr, a Gold Pseudodragon is Myk’s familiar. He thinks he is much larger than he actually is and reacts favorably to those who use his full name. 

Thia's Apothecary
Thia's is known for selling quality potions, health products as well as herbs and spices in bulk. Their prices are very reasonable.
