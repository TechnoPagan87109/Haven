The Shadows
etween the Shopps and the Officials is called the Shadows, which is not nearly as dark as one might think. It is from an old Halfling poem about two young people in love sneaking out for a kiss. There are two very popular Temples here, one to Tymore, the goddess of good fortune and one to Lliira, the goddess of joy. And while both have Chapels expressly for prayer and contemplation most of the buildings are used for slightly different purposes. The Temple of Tymore for instance is primarily a Gambling Hall. The few Boarding Houses here are run down, cheap and dangerous. Most who rent rooms here do so from other businesses, especially Taverns, the safest and most well known in the area is the Greasy Weasel Tavern.
