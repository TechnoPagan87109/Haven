The Shopps

As told by Baern Hoffenhorn, shield dwarf priest of Dugmaren Brightmantle, self-appointed promoter of the Shopps:
The largest cluster of buildings inside the walls of Haven is the Shopps.  Probably means it's the most important district, right?  (with a wink)  Don't let those stuffy folks in the Officials or all that noise from the Crafts fool you, the things you need the most are found in the Shopps!  Weavers, potters, dressmakers, bookbinders and the like.  When I speak to newcomers to Haven, the first question that always comes up is, "If they make things in the Crafts and they make things in the Shopps, then why do they need two places?"  Well, it's like this:  if the making of the things involves hammering, banging (such as done by my fellow dwarves!), shaking, bad smells, or explosions then itâ€™s done in the Crafts.  Everything else you can find in the Shopps.

Now there are some other lovely things to be found in the Shopps.  For example, let me tell you about something that holds a special place in my heart.  Have you heard of the Temple of All Gods?  No?!  Oh, my good traveler, even those who worship the most obscure deities can find a place for prayer and contemplation in the Temple!  I've been working hard on behalf of the Wandering Tinker to provide a place of respite and solace for all who find their way to Haven, whether they were looking for Haven or not.  Perhaps we could exchange tales of the wondrous deeds of our respective deities the next time you stop in!

Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all of the fine boarding houses to be found in the Shopps, the most in any of the districts!  Cozy homes as well, as many of the families with children live here.  And while it's not a law, an agreement among neighbours means that none of the establishments here sell alcohol, encourage gambling, or offer any other adult entertainment.  Oh, is that a slight frown I see on your face?  No worries, my friend, there are wonderful places to relax and enjoy a hot meal and refreshing, albeit non-alcoholic, drink with friends.  I highly recommend the Stumbalon Inn, where they have games of skill or chance (just friendly games, no gambling) and songs and stories from the finest bards in all of Haven and any plane that happens to intersect with our lovely home!

Temple of All Gods

Even those who worship the most obscure deities can find a place for prayer and contemplation in the Temple of All Gods.
Stumbalon Inn
The proprietors are the halfling couple, Finnan and Lidda Glenfellow.  High quality food and lodging at reasonable prices.  They have a modest menu, but what they serve is very well-prepared.  There isn't the usual bar, but there are a couple of long, rectangular high top tables that encourage strangers to share space and start discussions, both amongst themselves and with the staff.  The proprietors are very fond of striking up conversations with the patrons!  In addition to the food and lodging, the Inn has live bardic performances at least 4 nights a week, with the dazzling Muse Ronwe the featured act.
The Arcade

 "Come one, come all, test your skill and try your luck with the wonders of the Arcade!"  A large, dark, and extremely furry tabaxi, dressed in bright colours and wearing a magnificent hat, calls out from the entrance to the Arcade.
