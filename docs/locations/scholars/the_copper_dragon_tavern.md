This is a popular hangout for adventurers.  The proprietors are well-connected and often know of adventuring groups forming and patrons hiring as well as most of the latest rumors floating around Haven.  In a back room there are tables for playing cards and dice, along with dart boards.  There is a stage where local and traveling bards perform for tips.  Modest, comfortable, and wealthy lodging options are available.  The tavern is run by Theran and Zizza Amakiir and their four employees, though lately the employees are doing most of the work while Theran and Zizza care for their baby daughter.

## Proprietors

### Theran Amakiir

Theran, a half-elf, was a fighter, originally from Yartar, a city on west coast of Faerun on the world of Toril.  Her mother and father had both been adventurers in their younger days, which is how they met and fell in love.  Theran always believed she would meet someone the same way and to tease Zizza often jokes that the Fates have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  She traveled to Haven in the early part of '95 in search of adventure.  She says she was trapped here, first by the Tearing, then by her love for Zizza.

### Zizza Amakiir

Zizza, a human, grew up on the streets of Waterdeep an orphan, where she learned to steal, pick pockets, then locks, and became an adventurer this way.  She was in the market when the gnomes and Danarians first came and was one of the first to learn about Haven.  She went back with them, then found work at the Copper Dragon, which is where she and Theran first met.  She says she fell in love with Theranat first sight and that Theran just needed a little time to get on board.  Zizza says the next time they go to [Cassandra's Magic](./cassandras_magic) for the purpose of having another child, she wants to be the father.  Theran isn't sure if this is a promise or a threat.
