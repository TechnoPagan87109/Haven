Available for a wide variety of spell casting needs, Cassandra's Magic also sells a selection of potions and scrolls at reasonable prices.  Magic items can be crafted to the client's specifications.  There are also three small workspaces in the back available for rent or lease.  Each is equipped with basic magical equipment, while more specialized equipment may be borrowed as available, all included in the rental price.  Cassandra is specifically not available.  Any client who insists on her personal attention is charged a 200% surcharge that she refers to as an "annoyance tax".  

Cassandra has apprentices so that she can devote her full attention to Haven's planar travel problem.  She spends nearly all her time on the roof of the three story building that houses Cassandra's Magic with what most folks call "The Device".  Well over 20 feet in height and taking up most of the roof, it's composed of polished brass, steel and crystal, wheels upon wheels, balance beams, gears, springs, and pendulums, and is in constant motion.  She sits at the base of the thing, studying it and occasionally casting Mage Hand to adjust its workings.  Cassandra believes that a chunk of primordial chaos circles Haven in an eccentric orbit.  She believes that if she can make sense of that orbit, she can stop the rifts entirely and make travel in and out of Haven safe again.

## Proprietor

### Cassandra

Gnome artificer and creator of the games and puzzles of the Arcade.  Reserved and awkward, but brilliant.  Origins are unknown, but it may be the case that he is from Mount Nevermind on Krynn, rather than from Faerun as is the case with most gnomes in Haven.  In either case, he stands a little apart from most people, whether they're gnomes or not.  Can often be found muttering to himself while hunched over a project.  Makes a very functional odd couple with Moxie and their Arcade is a great success.  Pleasant to speak with if you can coax him into opening up, but he does tend to go on a bit.  Always seems relieved that someone wants to take the time to speak with him, but won't reveal the secrets of the wonders of the Arcade.  Moxie tends to think of him as the son he never had, which Kipper finds to be strange, but there are a lot of things about Moxie that are strange.
