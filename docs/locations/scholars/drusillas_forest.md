Drusilla Liadon runs a chained library that is free for all the citizens of Haven.  It consists of the three main stacks, each capable of seating ten people, with five on each side.  There are two smaller bookcases against the walls that can seat two more people each.  Anyone wanting their own copy of a book can contract with Drusilla, who will have one of her kenku assistants produce a duplicate.  She keeps rare or unusual books for sale in the back.  Drusilla also teaches a variety of languages, time permitting.  There is a box for donations.  She is considered quite eccentric.  The name of her establishment is a joke more obvious in Elven than Common that most wood elves find offensive.

## Proprietor

### Drusilla Liadon

Drusilla, a wood elf, is a book dealer and a Danarian in the sense that she lived there from before the Fall until the Evacuation.  While Danarians have a reputation for being extraordinarily resilient, this is not true of many of the initial survivors, some of whom were long-lived enough to have experienced the entire time in Hell.  Drusilla seems to have been 'broken' by the experience.  While her knowledge of academic subjects is encyclopedic, her personal memories come and go and change without warning or reason.  She is subject to fits of rage, terror, and confusion, sometimes in rapid succession.  This does not seem to affect her linguistic expertise, as she teaches a variety of languages.

Drusilla lives alone in a small apartment above her shop and has been known to be quite hostile and even violent to other wood elves.
